            <p>
                The RISC-V Pipeline Simulator has been developed as a learning environment,
                <br>to teach students in Computer Architecture how an assembly program is executed in a 5-stage pipeline.
                <br>The students can enable and disable hazard solving, and thereby inspect their effects on the ordering of instructions.
                <br>The RISC-V Pipeline Simulator offers a RISC-V assembly editor, a pipeline illustration with or with hazards,
                and the display of register and memory content during execution.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Type a RISC-V assembly program in the RISC-V Assembly Code editor.
                    <br>The table above shows all the instruction types that you can use in your program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press the button "Pipeline Instructions" to see your assembly program in the pipeline.
                    <br>Use the error feedback in the window below the "Pipeline Instructions" button to correct
                    your assembly code, if nothing appears in the Five-stage Pipeline window.
                    <br>Once your program is free of error, press the button again, and your program should appear in the pipeline.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are five stages connected by a wire in the Five-stage Pipeline, one for every instruction in your assembly code.
                    <br>Click on the line numbers in the assembly editor, to locate an instruction in the pipeline.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your assembly program contains either both data and control hazards, only data hazards, only control hazards, or no hazards.
                    <br>The two switches underneath the Five-stage pipeline are enabled depending on which hazard types occur.
                    <br>The switch color coding can be read as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The switch is enabled and unchecked.</li>
                        <li>The switch is enabled and checked.</li>
                        <li>The switch is disabled.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Click on an enabled switch to see hazards being solved in the pipeline illustration.
                    <br>The lines across the pipeline represents forwarding of data in the case of data hazards.
                    <br>Bubble figures show the stall of an instruction in case of a data hazard.
                    <br>Changed order and frequency of instructions show that the branch and jump instructions has been evaluated as a solution to control hazards.
                    <br>Wave figures show the flushing of instructions in case of wrongly predicted instruction order as a solution to control hazards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When both switches are checked, and the pipeline is free of hazards, the register and memory contents can be explored.
                    <br>Click on a clock cycle in the pipeline illustration header, to see the contents at that time in the register/memory table.
                    <br>Click on the rectangular switch above the register/memory table to change between register and memory display.
                </li>
            </ol>
